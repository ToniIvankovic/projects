# projects
Just some small projects I have been working on at the side

  
Sparivanje po listi preferencija:
  Pairing up people based on their preference lists.
  Pairs are reflexive, meaning that paired people actually for a pair (if A draws B, B draws A).
  The pairs are made in such a manner that the maximum satisfaction is achieved.
  
Tajni prijatelj:
  Secret Santa simulation, assigning a "pair" to each person, based on their preference list. 
  The pairs are not necessarily reflexive, e.g. A can draw B, and B can draw C.
  The pairs are made in such a manner that the maximum satisfaction is achieved.
